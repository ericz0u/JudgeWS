            "Sub Question 0: What are the key strategies for winning in TCG Weiss Schwarz?\n",
            "Answer: Understanding the card interactions, mastering the game mechanics, and building a well-balanced deck are key strategies for winning in TCG Weiss Schwarz. Additionally, being familiar with the rules, knowing how to effectively use card abilities, and adapting your gameplay based on the situation are important aspects to consider for success in the game.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 1: What are the win conditions in TCG Weiss Schwarz?\n",
            "Answer: If any player fulfills any losing conditions, that player loses the game by rule action the next time rule actions are performed. Winning conditions in TCG Weiss Schwarz include having the opponent lose while you do not, or winning or losing the game by a card effect during resolution.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 2: What is the rule number for brainstorming in TCG Weiss Schwarz?\n",

            "Sub Question 3: What are the rules for resolving a brainstorm ability in TCG Weiss Schwarz?\n",
            "Answer: When cards are put into the resolution zone by a Brainstorm ability in TCG Weiss Schwarz, they are initially placed in the resolution zone temporarily before being moved to the owner's waiting room. The resolution zone is a public zone where all cards are placed face up, allowing all players to view the information and order of the cards. However, players are not permitted to alter the order of cards in the resolution zone. Cards put into this zone are stacked on top of those already present.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 4: What are the win conditions in TCG Weiss Schwarz?\n",
            "Answer: If any player fulfills any losing conditions, that player loses the game by rule action the next time rule actions are performed. If a player has four or more cards in their level or if a player has zero cards in their deck and waiting room, they fulfill a losing condition. If any player loses, the game ends immediately. If your opponent loses and you do not, you win the game. Players may also win or lose the game by a card effect, in which case the game ends without proceeding to a check timing.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 5: What happens to the last four cards revealed by a Brainstorm ability in Weiss Schwarz when you refresh the deck?\n",
            "Answer: The last four cards revealed by a Brainstorm ability in Weiss Schwarz move to the Waiting Room when you refresh the deck.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 6: How does JudgeBot determine the resolution order of on-reverse effects when two cards are reversed at the same time?\n",
            "Answer: JudgeBot determines the resolution order of on-reverse effects when two cards are reversed at the same time based on the fundamental order of the continuous abilities belonging to the characters in their current stage positions.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 7: Which player resolves their on reverse effect first when two cards are reversed at the same time?\n",
            "Answer: The player whose turn it is resolves their on-reverse effect first when two cards are reversed at the same time.\n",
            "====================================\n",
            "Sub Question 8: How does Weiss Schwarz handle resolving on-reverse effects when two cards are reversed at the same time?\n",
            "Answer: Weiss Schwarz allows the turn player to choose the order in which the abilities of the two reversed cards are resolved. The turn player can decide which card's ability to resolve first, whether it involves sending a card to clock, stock, or any other zone. Once the turn player resolves their abilities, the other player then proceeds to resolve their card's abilities accordingly. This system ensures that both cards' on-reverse effects can be fully resolved in a fair and structured manner.\n",
